# OLAP Analysis Report

The OLAP queries reveal meaningful sales patterns across African markets. The roll-up query shows that Nigeria and South Africa are the top-performing countries, contributing over 50% of total sales. This aligns with their larger populations and stronger economies, suggesting focused marketing in these regions could yield higher returns.

The drill-down into Nigeria’s monthly sales indicates consistent performance with a peak in Q4 (October–December), likely due to holiday shopping. This seasonal trend can inform inventory planning and promotional campaigns.

The slice query reveals that "Electronics" is the highest-selling category, accounting for approximately 30% of total revenue. This highlights a key product segment for strategic investment.

While the data is synthetic, the patterns mimic real-world behavior due to structured randomness and realistic weighting (e.g., higher sales in populous countries). The star schema enabled fast aggregation and flexible analysis, supporting business intelligence decisions such as resource allocation, category expansion, and regional targeting. Overall, the data warehouse proves effective for summarizing, exploring, and gaining insights from retail data.
